# Lysis 4-plate aspiration

This OT-2 protocol uses a multichannel pipette to aspirate the supernatant and add Wash Buffer for four 24-well plates at a time. This protocol requires four home-built magnetic modules (Supplementary Figure 1) and a p300 multichannel pipette.  

## Set-up:
1. Assemble the 24-well plates on top of the home-buit magnetic modules. It's recommended to secure with tape. 

## Notes:

To use simulate, modify the custom labware path in the script.
