This OT-2 protocol uses a multichannel pipette to dispense Lysis Buffer to each well in four 24-well plates. This protocol requires a p300 multichannel pipette.  

## Set-up:
1.  Fill two 195 mL reservoirs with 100 mL Lysis Buffer in each.  

## Notes:

To use simulate, modify the custom labware path in the script.
