# BCA assay

This OT-2 protocol uses multichannel pipettes to combine the proteins samples and control samples with the BCA reagent. This protocol requires a p20 multichannel pipette and a p300 multichannel pipette.

## Set-up:
1. Prepare BSA standards 

    Reference the Excel sheet (BSA_controls_prep.xlsx) to prepare controls from 2000 ug/mL down to 0 ug/mL using the same buffer as the samples.

2. Prepare ~29 mL of BCA reagent (Recommended: Pierce Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit - 29 mL Reagent A and 0.58 mL Reagent B)

3. Into the 12-well reservoir, load the BCA reagent.

    11 mL into A1 (for samples in columns 1-6)

    11 mL into A2 (for samples in columns 1-6)

    7 mL in A3 (for controls)

## Notes:
Ensure accurate calibration of plate reader plates.

To use simulate, modify the custom labware path in the script.
