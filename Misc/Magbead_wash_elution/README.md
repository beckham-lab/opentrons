# MagBead Wash and Elution

This OT-2 protocol uses a multichannel pipette to wash the magnetic beads and add elution buffer. This protocol requires an OT-2 Magnetic Module GEN2 and a p300 multichannel pipette.    

## Set-up:

1. Wash Buffer plate - each well loaded with 1.2 mL

    Example buffer: 20 mM TRIS pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole

2. Elution Buffer plate - each well loaded with 600 uL

    Example Buffer: 20 mM TRIS pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole


## Notes:

To use simulate, modify the custom labware path in the script.
