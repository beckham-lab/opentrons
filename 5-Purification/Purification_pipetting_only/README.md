# Purification pipetting only

This OT-2 protocol uses a multichannel pipette to wash the magnetic beads and add the protease. This protocol requires an OT-2 Magnetic Module GEN2 and a p300 multichannel pipette.    

## Set-up:

1. Wash Buffer plate - each well loaded with 1.2 mL

    Example buffer: 20 mM TRIS pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole

2. Cleavage Buffer plate - each well loaded with 1.2 mL

    Example Buffer: 20 mM TRIS pH 8, 300 mM NaCl

3. Protease plate - each well of Column 1 loaded with 460 uL

    Example protease loading: 0.75 mg/mL SUMO protease

## Notes:
Recommended to seal the plate and shake on a 3mm orbit shaker to mix protease and magbeads. In the absence of a plate shaker, a pipette based mixing step is included in the protocol. 

To use simulate, modify the custom labware path in the script.
