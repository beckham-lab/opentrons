# Purification with OT-2 shaker

This OT-2 protocol uses a multichannel pipette to wash the magnetic beads and add the protease. This protocol requires an OT-2 Magnetic Module GEN2, an OT-2 Heater-Shaker Module, and a p300 multichannel pipette.   

## Set-up:

1. Wash Buffer plate - each well loaded with 1.8 mL

    Example buffer: 20 mM TRIS pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole

2. Cleavage Buffer plate - each well loaded with 1.8 mL

    Example Buffer: 20 mM TRIS pH 8, 300 mM NaCl

3. Protease plate - each well of Column 1 loaded with 460 uL

    Example protease loading: 0.75 mg/mL SUMO protease


## Notes:

To use simulate, modify the custom labware path in the script.
