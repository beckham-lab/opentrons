# DSF

This OT-2 protocol uses multichannel pipettes to combine the proteins samples with the Sypro Orange dye. This protocol requires a p20 multichannel pipette and a p300 multichannel pipette.

## Set-up:
1. Prepare 900 uL of Sypro Dye at 50X (9 uL of 5000X stock with 891 uL water or buffer)
2. Load 100 uL of the 50X Sypro Dye in all wells of Column 1 of Sypro plate. 

## Notes:
A script (*plot_DSF.py*) for analyzing data from a Bio Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR instrument is provided.

To use simulate, modify the custom labware path in the script.
