# Introduction

This repository contains scripts to perform automated steps in the recombinant expression and purification of proteins in *E. coli* assisted by the OT-2 robot. Futher details on the development and use of these protocols can be found in the paper cited below. 

## Comments
- In order to use the simulate function to test protocols, the user must define the path to the custom labware in each protocol script. 
- Most of the available protocols return the tips to their rack to facilitate washing and reuse. 


- Swap out custom labware paths (#custom_labware_file_path = 'path/to/your/custom_labware.json')
