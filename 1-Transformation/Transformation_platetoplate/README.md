# Transformation plate-to-plate (plate stamp)

This OT-2 protocol uses a multichannel pipette to transfer the plasmids from the plasmid library plate to the transformation plate in a direct plate stamp. This protocol requires the OT-2 Temperature Module GEN2, a p300 multichannel (left), and a p20 multichannel pipette (right).

## Set-up:
1. Load the NEST 12-well reservoir with X mL of competent cells into well A1. 
2. Load 50 mL of LB into the NEST 195 mL 1-well reservoir in deck position 7. 
3. Load 50 mL of LB with 3X antibiotic into the NEST 195 mL 1-well reservoir in deck position 6. 
6. Run the protocol. 
7. After the protocol pauses after LB addition, seal the plate and shake-incubate for 1 h for outgrowth. 
8. Return the plate to the robot, unseal, and resume the protocol to add LB + 3X antibiotic. 
9. After the protocol is complete, seal the plate and shake-incubate until saturated (up to 40 h). 

## Notes:
Recommended to pre-chill the 12-well reservoir for the competent cells and the 96-well transformation plate. 

To use simulate, modify the custom labware path in the script.
